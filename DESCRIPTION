Description: 
    This package is designed to take 2D maps of fuel biomass (probably generated
    at a moderate resolution, e.g., 10-30m) and apportion per-pixel biomass to
    finer-scale (e.g., 1m) voxels. This is done using lidar point cloud data
    (airborne, UAS, or terrestrial), and assumes that the density of lidar
    points in a given voxel corresponds to the proportion of fuel in that voxel.
    Given the canopy occlusion that occurs with airborne lidar data, this 
    package also allows for the application of Beer's law to boost understory
    biomass estimation. It also allows for rasterization of the final voxel-
    level estimates, for visualization purposes.
